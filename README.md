# Trekking With Trappenberg


"Trekking With Trappenberg" is a collection of code that I learn and implement while studying the fundamentals of theoretical and computational neuroscience. As evident from the name, the explored problems and exercises are mostly from the book _Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience_ by _Thomas P. Trappenberg_ but are not limited to just the one book. Various other books and resources I come across in the process will be referred to as well.
